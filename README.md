This will have something soon, for now just look at the code or subdirectories.


TODO LIST:
- Improve README for both [code-context](code-context/README.md) and [code-edit](code-edit/README.md). I need to add the `claude_desktop_config.json`
instructions and potential PATH issues with bun. 
- CI/CD and/or standardized approach towards versioning and publishing of packages. (python, typescript, and zig will need to be considered)
- Figure out how I want to handle prompts. Right now `code-context` has a prompt but it's kinda lame. I think prompts can be dynamic, as I continue working
through tools I'll likely have ideas for how I want this to work.
- LSP client MCP server, for parsing out errors from files. This will be python-based.
